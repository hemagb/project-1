## Project Name : Effect of Hurricanes on Quality of Life

### Outline: 
  * Map where natural disasters occur for reference
  * Create dataframe that holds all data. Clean as you go before merging to master dataframe
  * Grab relevant data such as housing markets, crime rates, median income, etc., all related to quality of life
 
 
### Questions to answer: 
* How does quality of life change following a natural disaster?
* Do metrics go up or down?
* Are certain cities/states prone to more dramatic changes in quality of life metrics than others? i.e. does the state of Florida experience more property crimes per capita following a hurricane than the state of Alabama?
* What is the change over time in quality of life metrics for cities affected by hurricanes? How long does it take for City X to see normalized crime prior to disaster Y, for instance? How well does the data reflect the resiliency of a city?
* Do major metropolitan cities experience more or less dramatic changes in these aforementioned metrics than smaller cities or towns?
  
### Datasets to be used: 
  * FBI API
  * FEMA API
  * US Census Buereau


### Breakdown of tasks:

Data collection: 
* Create dataframe with all relevant locations of hurricans for the past two years
  * Plot this on a map
* Create dataframe with all relevant census data, including an axis you can merge on to the master dataframe

Plot: 
* Plot all relevant metrics (crime rate, housing, number of jobs, health effects) to scatter plots

### Clean Data:

 * drop any rows or data that has missing information
 * Plot all relevant findings
